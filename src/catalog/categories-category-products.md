The Products in Category section lists the products that are currently assigned to the category{% if "Default.CE Only" contains site.edition %}.{% endif %}{% if "Default.EE-B2B" contains site.edition %}, and allows you to use [category rules]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link catalog/category-product-rules.md %}) to dynamically change the product selection when a set of conditions is met.{% endif %}{% if "Default.CE Only" contains site.edition %}The search filters at the top of each column are used to add and remove products from the category.{% endif %}{% if "Default.EE-B2B" contains site.edition %}To learn more, see: [Visual Merchandiser]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link marketing/visual-merchandiser.md %}).{% endif %}

## To apply a category rule:

1. Set **Match products by rule** to the “Yes” position.

   The automatic sorting and condition options appear.

   *To Match Products by Rule*

   **Automatic Sort**

   To apply a sort order automatically to the list, based on current conditions, set **Automatic Sorting** to one of the following:

   | Stock level | Move to top or bottom. |
   | Special price | Move to top or bottom. |
   | New Products | List newest products first. |
   | Color | Sort alphabetically by color. |
   | Name | Sort in ascending or descending order by Name. |
   | SKU | Sort in ascending or descending order by SKU |
   | Price | Sort in ascending or descending order by Price. |
   {:style="table-layout:auto"}

   **Add Condition**

   1. Tap <span class="btn">Add Condition</span>, Then, do the following:

      * Choose the **Attribute** that is the basis of the condition.
      * Choose the **Operator** that is needed to form the expression.
      * Enter the **Value** that is to be matched.

      ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link images/images-ee/category-rule-create.png %}){: .zoom}
      *Add Condition to Category Rule*

   1. Repeat this process for each attribute that is needed to describe the condition(s) to be met. For example, to match products that were created between 7 and 30 days ago, do the following:

      * Set **Date Created** to “Less than 30”.
      * Set **Logic** to “AND”.
      * Set **Date Modified** to “Greater than 7”.

1. When complete, tap <span class="btn">Save Category</span>.

When setting up a category rule, the products are matched and assigned to the rule when the category is saved. Therefore, if you add a new product to the catalog and want to include it in the rule, you must re-save each category that is set to match products by rule, to ensure that the new product is included.
